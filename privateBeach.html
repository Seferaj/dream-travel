              <h1>Englishman's Bay, Trinidad and Tobago</h1>
            <p>Englishman's Bay is a secluded beach on the leeward coast of Tobago, between Castara and Parlatuvier. Although the bay draws fewer beach-goers that Tobago's western beaches do, it is considered one of the island's most beautiful. The beach itself is a classic crescent shape, capped by two heavily forested headlands descending from Tobago's Main Ridge.</p>          </div>

              <p>To reach Secret Beach you must follow an unmarked, unpaved road to a small parking lot and walk for about 10 minutes on a foot path down to the west end of the beach. This foot path is not exceptionally steep, but it is usually slick and muddy, making the hike down and back up a challenge for some. </p></div>
